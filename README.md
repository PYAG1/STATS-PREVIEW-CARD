## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
This challenge enabled me to apply my knowledge in CSS Flexbox.

I also got introduced to the use of the```background-blend-mode:;``` css property. Which helped in styling the background image.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
#first-section{
    background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    background-image: url("C:/Users/PYAG/Desktop/stats-preview-card-component-main/images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
    background-blend-mode:multiply;
    background-size: cover;...}
    ```
